	* More fixes from Paulo:
	* To avoid virtual method dispatch resulting in infinite loop, the
	  meta object instance is now created in c++ code using smoke (just as
	  in qtruby).
	* Qyoto.GetMetaObject now works for Qt types as well
	* Decommented code in set_obj_info. This function is used by the
	  return value marshaller for non-primitive types and by
	  make_metaObject.

	* Added patch from Paulo Capriotti to create a QMetaObject at runtime
	  for a Qyoto class with custom slots and/or signals

	* Added code from Arno Rehn to access obtain the return value of
	  a classes Emit() method as an interface and obtain the C++ signal 
	  type signatures and set them up in HashTables with a top level
	  table with the classes as keys, containing sub tables with the
	  C++ signatures as keys which map onto the correponding C# 
	  MethodInfo as a value
	* Some fixes from Paolo Capriotti:
		* Added fix for a crash in SmokeInvocation.cs when a class with
		  virtual methods wasn't a subclass of Qt
		* The code for emitting signals now works with Qt4
		* The code in QObject.cs to set up the transparent proxy Q_EMIT 
		  for an instance's signal interfaces now works.

	* The Hash table to get a marshaller given a type name wasn't working.
	  Thanks to Paolo Capriotti for the fix.

	* C# bindings roughly converted from Qt3 to Qt4. (doesn't work yet).

	* Regenerated the Qt4 *.cs sources
