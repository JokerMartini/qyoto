* Added a PlasmaScripting.Applet class which will be subclassed to implement
  ScriptEngine based C# plasmoids. The Plasma.Applet source was copied and
  enums and static methods were removed. The code in the public methods was
  changed to forward the method call to the underlying applet. To do this for
  the protected methods, reflection will need to be used.
* Added an implicit type conversion operator so that a PlasmaScripting.Applet
  can be used in the Plasma api everywhere a Plasma.Applet would be expected.
