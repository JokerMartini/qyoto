* Add a port of the KWrite shell to C#
* There are some problems to be solved:
	* Accessing some functionality requires qobject_cast<>'s
	* How should mono KDE apps be installed? Should they be installed into
	  the bin dir, or they should they be started from a C++ shell like Ruby
	  KDE apps?
	* Couldn't see how to convert this call:
		QTextStream input(stdin, QIODevice::ReadOnly);
	* The KUrl.List class needs more work to be usuable with drag and drop
