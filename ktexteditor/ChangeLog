* Fix some issues with the KWrite example
    * SetXmlFile() was being given the wrong filename, which meant that the
      menus and menu option were in the wrong order
    * The Connect() to the close app slot was wrong
    * Fixed the loop to open files via their urls from the open file dialog
    * A KIO.NetAccess.Exists() call crashes and needed to be commented out
    * KCmdLineArgs parsing is borked, and the code to do that is skipped at
      at the moment
    * In Qyoto the CreateInstance() method doesn't work with nested classes
      as they are wrongly named. For instance, 
      Kimono.KEncodingFileDialog.Result should be passed as
      Kimono.KEncodingFileDialog+Result because nested classes have '+'s 
      rather than '.'s. So the start up code for a Qyoto module needs to use
      C# reflection to get each C# class and obtain the corresponding Smoke
      class and put them in the lookup map.
* Added some KTextEditor marshallers

* Add a port of the KWrite shell to C#
* There are some problems to be solved:
    * Accessing some functionality requires qobject_cast<>'s
    * How should mono KDE apps be installed? Should they be installed into
      the bin dir, or they should they be started from a C++ shell like Ruby
      KDE apps?
    * Couldn't see how to convert this call:
        QTextStream input(stdin, QIODevice::ReadOnly);
    * The KUrl.List class needs more work to be usuable with drag and drop
