* Added tutorial examples p3 and p4. p4 crashes on a call to 
  KHTMLPart.Widget(), which could be a problem with modular smoke
  either method lookup or return value marshalling.
* Don't convert QChars to C# chars, keep them as QChars
* Added the name of the current Assembly as the first entry in the args
  array passed to KCmdLineArgs.Init().

* Added marshallers for the various types of lists in the KDE classes
* Special case the Init() methods in KCmdLineArgs to take string[] args,
  for the C++ 'int, char[] *' pairs.
