	* Prefer const methods over non-const methods.

2008-06-18  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

* Added tutorial examples p3 and p4. p4 crashes on a call to 
  KHTMLPart.Widget(), which could be a problem with modular smoke
  either method lookup or return value marshalling.
* Don't convert QChars to C# chars, keep them as QChars
* Added the name of the current Assembly as the first entry in the args
  array passed to KCmdLineArgs.Init().
* Added the p7 tutorial. There is a problem with this line:

    KConfig config = KApplication.kApplication().SessionConfig();
    location.Text = 
      config.Group("Settings").ReadEntry("defaultPage", "http://localhost");

  The Group() method isn't found in the smoke lib

* Added marshallers for the various types of lists in the KDE classes
* Special case the Init() methods in KCmdLineArgs to take string[] args,
  for the C++ 'int, char[] *' pairs.
